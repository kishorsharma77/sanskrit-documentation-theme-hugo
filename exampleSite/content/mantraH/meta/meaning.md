title: Meaning
---

## Intro
- To understand what a mantra says and, to feel what the mantra feels: This is one good reason why learning Sanskrit, with its stresses (svara-s) is valuable.
- General background on multi-level ways to derive meaning out of texts in general is presented [here](../../bases/books/index/).

## Meaning denouncers
- Some claim that it is not necessary to understand what the words in the mantra mean (to whatever extant the grammar would allow). 
- "The chArvAka holds that the mantra-s are useless & probably senseless too. In support of the latter he would cite the famous vaidika jarbharI turpharI sUkta to the ashvin-s by a certain kAshyapa and point out the eponymous words are unetymologizable in Skt & convey the senselessness of mantra-s in addition to their uselessness."
- The kautsa in contrast is a v1 who doesn't say that mantra-s are useless; he wants them to be appropriately pronounced with fidelity but sees them as mostly meaningless because: 
  - 1) they follow a fixed word order whereas a real sentence would alter that word order in different ways (especially in Skt). 
  - 2) The literal understanding of a mantra text in Skt results in meanings that cannot possibly be true.
  - 3)They are replete with statements of opposite meaning. 
- Via [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1276383217290010626): Finally we have a third slightly different position who I suspect were the successors of the kautsa-s who were around during the classical mImAMsA exegesis. These chaps held that you can read meanings into mantra-s as they are for most part in Skt which you might understand directly or interpret like yAska & the shaunaka had done formerly. However, these meanings are not important, not the *purpose* of mantra & definitely not the intention of a mantra & its deployment. What was valid was it correct pronunciation & deployment at in the right ritual juncture. The nyAya of a blind man having eyes but they being dysfunctional is used by some proponents of this school. In some ways this is "kautsa lite".
  - Via [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1276383217290010626): However, despite opposition by influential AchArya-s this view has had a certain popular adherence. We see the average mantra-sAdhaka learning the shruti or other mantra-s by rote but not understanding their meaning at all. At times not even the most basic sense. However, this mantra-vAha might perform a ritual flawlessly without a clue of what he uttered in accompaniment. We see this a triumph of the kautsa position. 
- kautsa opinion is denounced by authorities such as yAska, shaunaka and shikShA texts.
  - Such opinion is condemned in quotes in shikSha texts which denounce pATha without "understanding" with the aid of vedAnga-s (शीघ्रपाठी…). 

## Importance of meaning
- While a mantra can contain meanings beyond what is revealed by mere grammar and vocabulary, that lower level of meaning is important in itself, and as an aid to access deeper meanings.
- Via [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1276383217290010626): "The essence of yAska who defends against the kautsa pUrvapakSha is that all these purported features of mantra-s are common place in laukika Skt hence to claim that specially negate meaningfulness of mantra-s is an empty claim because by the same token they should also make laukika speech meaningless (contra what kautsa holds). Thus, yAska holds that one must pursue the etymology of the difficult words and find their meaning to understand mantra-s." 
- Via [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1276383217290010626): The learned mImAMsAchArya-s of yore have already posited that this is untenable because you cannot observe vaidika injunction or dharma correctly if you cannot apprehend their meaning. Hence, the very validity of basing your dharma on shruti is negated by not knowing the meaning. I personally attach a further point which is often neglected even by those who accept the need to know meaning.
- Following shaunaka & his successors I hold that it is not just enough to know the meaning of a mantra but also the connection of the mantra in meaning and/or form to the deity of the mantra i.e. **devatA**. The mantra's validity needs both meaning & devatA. 

## stobha-s
- Via [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1276383217290010626): It the AV, YV & RV shruti this is mostly transparent if you can understand the mantra to a degree. But one might turn around & say that the sAman has meaningless stobha-s & the whole thing is rendered meaningless with lopa & vikR^iti. So is mantra not meaningless after all. I say no: there is meaning which acquired by the connection to the devatA which exists via the form of the mantra (so meaning can also be structural).
  - Via [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1276383217290010626): To give a proper biochemical analogy: A protein can have a globular structure with well defined strands & helices in a particular folding. This might catalyze a reaction or bind another molecule. This protein has a "functional sense" akin to a typical shruti mantra. A protein might have low entropy but clear cut repetitive structures like fibers. It is not that such proteins have no "functional sense". They do perform some key, often structural, functions. Finally, a protein might have no structure or only assume such in certain conditions when combined with other molecules. Even such can have functional sense --like the glass like prionic states of low-complexity RNA-binding proteins. The latter two are like sAman-s with stobha-s inserted or pure stobha-gAnam.
  - Hence, once there is coupling to devatA there are many routes to meaning, even as for a protein when coupled to natural selection. This latter type of mantra like with stobha-s, stobha-gAna or kriyAshabda-s like phaT, huM etc is mirrored in the later mantra-s of the tAntrika mantra shAstra. Of course just like a low complexity protein outside the field of natural selection might be "functionally senseless" the bIja only or bIja riddled mantra-s might be senseless in ordinary Skt but coupled with the devatA they are fully sensible.
