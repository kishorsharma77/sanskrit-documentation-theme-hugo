[परवस्तु-साम-परम्परा-पृष्ठं](../paravastu-sAma-paramparA/) दृश्यताम्।

## पारम्परिकविधिः
- गुरुर् एकदा वदति। शिष्यो द्विरनुवदति - पुस्तकमदृष्ट्वा। एवं १०+वारम् अभ्यस्य ततः परं पुस्तकं दृष्ट्व्याऽभ्यस्यति। गुरुः परीक्ष्य शोधयति।

## स्वानुभवः
### मुख्यांशाः
- यथाश्रुतानुकरणम् प्रधानम्। लिखितपाठो गौणः, किञ्च कदाचिद् ग्राह्यतरः (सम्प्रदाये कदाचित् सन्देहास्पदा वर्णव्यत्ययास् तत्र तत्र विद्यन्ते)।
  - स्वरचिह्नानि किमर्थानीति सम्प्रदाये ज्ञानं नष्टप्रायम्। स्वरचिह्नानि कानीत्यवगन्तुं प्रयत्नो [ऽत्र](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dHkElOzXoAue48_xVgP-LAlSSpmMQ9QKjUrnSazEG1M/edit#heading=h.xyzfui7ansvz)।
  - This deviation from notation is seen in the myriad gAna traditions of other shAkhas as well. More at [svara page](../../../sanskrit/shixaa/svaraH/sAmaveda/)

### santhA recordings
I practiced a few saamans using our santhA recordings. It was a wonderful experience - as if the guru were right here teaching me. This made me very excited - because not only will my apasvaras decrease as a result, it also opened the possibility of recording such santhA-s for all the sAman-s, so that even after I move away, I can use them to continue my practice and master them in due course, before occasionally scheduling an online zoom session with the teacher so that he can test and refine!

One other thing I noted is that the recording of the repetition does not matter so much because one concentrates on reproducing the guru's sound - so there might as well have been an empty gap after a phrase to allow repetition. That said, there is some minor use so that deviations from the recorded repetitions stand out.

Indeed, it also strikes me that after initial few months of in-person lessons to fix and improve one's "singing voice", others can use these santhA recordings to learn these sAman-s at home and please the deva-s agni, soma and indra!
